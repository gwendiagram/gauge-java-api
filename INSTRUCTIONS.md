# Sky Technical Test – API Automation

In this repo is a Ruby API built within Docker that we would like tested.  The developers have documented the API and have it running within Docker so it is easy to test on your local machine.  Your mission is to test the API and report back with your findings so the team are aware of any issues.

## Part 1 
Get the API and the test framework running on your machine.  Read the README.md in the repo and ensure you have docker, the API under test, Gauge and Java installed on your machine.

## Part 2
Our developers have created a documentation for the API which can be accessed at http://localhost:3000 however, there are some issues with it.  Spot the issues and document what will need to be amended.

## Part 3
Explore the API using your favourite API tool, be in Postman, CURL or Insomnia and document your findings.

## Part 4
The testers have worked on some API tests in Gauge using Java however, they haven’t yet finished them and some are failing.  Help the testers out by fixing their broken tests and adding any missing steps.  Is there anything that can be improved in the tests? Now is the time to make the tests shine!

## Part 5
How else would you test this API? Any test cases or documentation you create, check in with the code you have created.
